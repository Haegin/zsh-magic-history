# Zsh Magic History

This sets up Zsh with history settings that work across all the shells you have
open, updating the history for each shell without needing to close the shell.
It removes duplicates, only keeping the most recent and tidies up commands as
they're added, removing spaces, ignoring commands that start with a space
(useful for commands with passwords in, among other things), and ignoring
history commands.
